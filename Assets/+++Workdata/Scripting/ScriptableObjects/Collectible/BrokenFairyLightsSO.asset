  content: "Nothing magical about these fairy lights. Why did none of the daytime
    workers pick this thing up? There\u2018s no warning sign about shards laying
    around either. Some poor little kid would have run right into these if I didn\u2018t
    pick them up myself. I deserve better pay for saving this park from lawsuits."

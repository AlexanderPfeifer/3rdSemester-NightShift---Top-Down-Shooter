  content: "Some old and soggy newspaper. It\u2018s probably been laying around in
    a puddle for years - so much for cleaning staff. I can barely make out the headline:
    something about a kid getting lost around this park. This scandal happened years
    ago. Reporters these days are really just grasping for straws at this point;
    this is embarrassing, even for our town reporters. I\u2018m almost glad I can\u2018t
    read the rest of the article."
